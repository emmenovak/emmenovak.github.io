    <h1>CHANGE LOG</h1>
    <h3>Mid-term Page 1 Edits</h3>
    <hr>
    <p><b>Error 1:</b> line 2. The start tag is missing an identified language. I changed the original line to add "lang="en"" to the end of "html". By adding a lang attribute to the html start tag, I was able to declare the language of the document.</p>
    <p><b>Error 2:</b> line 25. Missing closing list tag located inside an unordered list. To fix this error I added the closing symbolic link tag to the end of the line. </p>
    <p><b>Error 3:</b> line 28. The error in this line is located in the file path for the image. The original line is trying to access only the file name and not were it is located. To fix this error I added "img/" infront of the image name in order to access the folder where the image is located. There was not a visible error when checked through W3C Validator due to the "alt" attribute which provides text labeling if the image is unable to be processed.</p>
    <p><b>Error 4:</b> line 29. I added a break tag in order to move the link underneath the image instead of next to it. This helps the visual aspect of the page.</p>
    <p><b>Error 5:</b> line 32. The error for this line is missing the closing p tag. The page is able to process the text without the tag but the correct syntax must include the closing paragraph tag.</p>
    <p><b>Error 6:</b> line 38. There is a missing closing data cell tag. The original line started with the opening table data tag but ended with no tag. I added the closing table data tag to define a standard data cell in an HTML table.</p>
    <p><b>Error 7:</b> line 44. The error is on line 44 for the opening tag for a table row element. This HTML element defines a row of cells in a table. This section was missing a closing table row tag. On line 44 I added the closing table row element.</p>
    <p><b>Error 8:</b> line 46. The error for this line is a missing closing table tag. To fix this I added the closing HTML table tag to the line.</p>

    <h3>Mid-term Page 2 Edits</h3>
    <hr>
    <p><b>Error 1:</b> line 28. The error at hand is an unescaped angled bracket. In this line following the opening bold tag, there is no bold tag inside the angle brackets. To fix this error I added the bold closing tag.</p>
    <p><b>Error 2:</b> line 56. The error in this line of code is the ordering of the tags. The h2 element is not allowed as a child of element b in this case. To fix this error I changed the ordering of the tags so the h2 element would come first making the b element the child element.</p>
    <p><b>Error 3:</b> line 56. I also changed the header size in the line to match the first heading so there is consistent styling on the website. I changed the headding size with a level-three heading element.</p>
    <p><b>Error 4:</b> line 57. The error I changed was adding the line break tag to keep consistent styling to the page.</p>
    <p><b>Error 5:</b> line 61. In the href attribute there is an illegal character in the path segment. The so called link "where do I go" is not valid because spaces are not allowed. To fix this error I made the phrase into a website link and removed the spaces.</p>
    <p><b>Error 6:</b> line 78. The error in this line is missing the end tag for the heading 6 tag. Without this closing tag being present, you get a bunch of errors relating to elements not being allowed as a child element to the opening h6 tag. To fix this error I added the closing header 6 tag on line 78.</p>
    <p><b>Error 7:</b> line 78. I also changed the heading tag for this line to have a consistent size throughout the website. I changed the header tag of a level-six header to a level-three header element.</p>
    <p><b>Error 8:</b> line 107. In this line I added a thematic break to continue consistent styling of this page. After the "Closure" section there needed to be a divider using the horizontal line element.</p>

    <h3>Mid-term Page 3 Edits</h3>
    <hr>
    <p><b>Error 1:</b> line 1. The first error is this page is missing the !DOCTYPE html tag. To fix this error I added the !DOCTYPE html tag enclosed in angle brackets.</p>
    <p><b>Error 2:</b> line 2. This error is from the html start tag not including a lang attribute. I added a lang attribute to the html start tag to declare the language of this document.</p>
    <p><b>Error 3:</b> line 4-9. This file did not include the head portion of the document and had no information realted to the document. For this error I added the meta (similar to the previous files) and the missing title.</p>
    <p><b>Error 4:</b> line 10. In the head of the file, there was no link to the given css file. To fix this error I used the "link:css" attribute to link the given cars.css stylesheet.</p>
    
    <h3>Mid-term Page 4 Edits</h3>
    <hr>
    <p><b>Error 1:</b> line 1. The first error is this page is missing the !DOCTYPE html tag. To fix this error I added the !DOCTYPE html tag enclosed in angle brackets. </p>
    <p><b>Error 2:</b> line 7. In this line I changed the title to match the rest of the pages. This is not so much sytax based but it is important for consistency across the pages.</p>
    <p><b>Error 3:</b> line 37. The original organization the the pictures and their groupings made the sets of photos layout horizontal which did not follow the structure of the headers. To fix this I re-arranged the order of the photos to match with each collumn. First row of cells: DogsFrolic, CatBoxing, and then Diamond Alien. Second row of cells: Dog Singing, Orange cat, and then Creature. Third row of cells: Lab Lab, Sun Cat, and Aliens Peace. </p>
    <p><b>Error 4:</b> line 40. The error for this line is a missing "alt" description. An "image" element must have an "alt" attribute so when an image cannot be displayed, alternate text will be there. To fix this error I added the alt atrribute to equal the text "Dogs Frolic".</p>
    <p><b>Error 5:</b> line 41. The error for this line is a missing "alt" description. An "image" element must have an "alt" attribute so when an image cannot be displayed, alternate text will be there. To fix this error I added the alt atrribute to equal the text "Boxing Cats".</p>

    <p><b>Error 8:</b> line 46. The mistake in this line is there is no ending table data cell element. There is no visible syntax error when checked through W3C Schools Validator but this is an important error that needs to be signified. To fix this error, I added the closing tag element for this cell of a table containing the photo using the closing table data cell element.</p>
    <p><b>Error 9:</b> line 47. The error for this line is a missing "alt" description. An "image" element must have an "alt" attribute so when an image cannot be displayed, alternate text will be there. To fix this error I added the alt atrribute to equal the text "Orange Cat".</p>
    <p><b>Error 10:</b> line 47. This line had a missing table data cell tags for both opening and closing tags. This element defines a cell of a table that contains data, in this case a photo. To fix this, I added both opening and closing Table data cell elements.</p>
    <p><b>Error 11:</b> line 48. The error for this line is a missing "alt" description. An "image" element must have an "alt" attribute so when an image cannot be displayed, alternate text will be there. To fix this error I added the alt atrribute to equal the text "Creature".</p>

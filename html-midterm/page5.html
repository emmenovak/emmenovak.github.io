    <h1>CHANGE LOG</h1>
    <h3>Page 1</h3>
    <p>Error 1: line 2. The start tag is missing an identified language. I changed the original line to add "lang="en"" to the end of "html". By adding a lang attribute to the html start tag, I was able to declare the language of the document.</p>
    <p>Error 2: line 25. Missing closing list tag located inside an unordered list. To fix this error I added the closing tag "< /ln>" to the end of the line. </p>
    <p>Error 3: line 28. The error in this line is located in the file path for the image. The original line is trying to access only the file name and not were it is located. To fix this error I added "img/" infront of the image name in order to access the folder where the image is located. There was not a visible error when checked through W3C Validator due to the "alt" attribute which provides text labeling if the image is unable to be processed.</p>
    <p>Error 4: line 31. The error for this line is missing the closing p tag. The page is able to process the text without the tag but the correct syntax must include the closing paragraph tag</p>
    <p>Error 5: line 37. There is a missing closing data cell tag. The original line started with the opening table data tag but ended with no tag. I added the closing table data tag to define a standard data cell in an HTML table.</p>
    <p>Error 6: line 43. On line 39 the opening tag for a table row element. This HTML element defines a row of cells in a table. This section was missing a closing table row tag. On line 43 I added the closing table row element.</p>
